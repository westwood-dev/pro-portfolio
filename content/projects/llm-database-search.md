### About project

This project is in collaboration with the Creative Computing Institute. The main goal of this project it to create a database that is explorable via a website and/or mobile app. The data will be stored as embeddings allowing for advanced latent exploration.

### Research / Initial ideas

Currently the main focus of research has been into possible interaction methods enabling accessibly to the 'latent interaction' from people without the specific understanding of latent space. Allowing for more natural data exploration without a chat style user interaction.

### System Stack
